When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Any time you want to allow others access to your code or to track changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Files may have been overwritten inadvertantly or perhaps are not ready to be published.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a complete copy of a repository.  A clone is a copy of a repository that includes all of the history.  A branch is a point in the history of a
repository.  You would use a fork when you want to make changes to a repository that you do not have permission to change.  You would use a clone when you want
to copy a repository.  You would use a branch when you want to make changes to a repository that can be easily merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Possible to guage changes between versions and revert back if needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Shared-drive or other cloud-based repositorty. Github makes it easier for multiple collaborators

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Might want to test out a new feature or functionality wihtout affective the main branch.
